It has been about a week since I launched this blog. I created this blog mainly for myself to document my learning journey. 
However, I also wanted feedback from people who visit this blog. I am learning data science online with no mentors. Having some sort of feedback is extremely valuable to me.
At the time of this post, I've had about seven visitors, two of them were my friends. Five of them were myself before I figured out how to exclude myself from google analytics. I also got about 37 bots that decided to visit one day. 

This is what my Google analytics look like right now:

</div>

The peak you see in the picture are all bots. 
I spent many hours learning about SEO, and constantly checking my search rankings. I realized that I must be doing something wrong and I needed help.

### The Plan

I decided to take a blogging course from John Sonmez from https://simpleprogrammer.com. 
I am a huge fan of John's Youtube channel, but he does have a tendency to heavily advertise his products and his brand. 
I believe that is fair, considering that his course was completely free. All I had to do was give him one of my many email addresses. So I have nothing to lose.
If you are interested, you can sign up for his course [here](https://simpleprogrammer.com/blog-course).

John's blogging course was 3 weeks long, split into 6 emails. The course is geared towards Wordpress. Since I am using Pelican, a lot of the information did not apply to me.
But I stuck with the course and even got this pixel badge.

Overall, I thought the course was really helpful. Because, it did make me realize one very important thing, the power of networking. It is so painfully obvious, but I always forget about it. 
It doesn't make sense to worry about SEO when I don't even have a single visitor to my blog. What I want is feedback from the data science community. It doesn't make sense to naturally expect people to find this blog and leave comments.

<b>I need to be a part of the community.</b>

Think of it this way, imagine that this website is a house. Right now, I am inside the house. I never talk to anyone, nor do I ask anyone to come visit my house. 
People don't even know that the house exist. So how can I expect anyone to know where my house is? 

My plan is to read famous data science blogs, and actively participate in the community. Hopefully in the future, when I feel confident enough with my skills, I can actively participate in community events.
