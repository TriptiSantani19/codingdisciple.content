Let's start with some definitions:

Discipline - noun, training to act in accordance with rules.

Motivation - noun, the act or an instance of motivating, or providing with a reason to act in a certain way.

From the definition,  discipline has more to do with rules that a person follows.
Whereas motivation is about providing a reason to act a certain way. 

I am a strong believer in discipline because motivation is only temporary.

For example, people often tell themselves that they need to exercise, but they never take any action. But one day, they suddenly feel like they should really do something about it, so they go outside and run a few miles.

Feeling motivated is easy. The hard part is doing it every single day. Think of it this way, most people don't like waking up in the morning and going to work.
But we do it anyway, is it because we are afraid of our boss? Possibly, but the main reason is because we are disciplined to do so. I used to work graveyard shift from 6 pm - 6 am. I can confidently say, I had zero motivation to go to work when I wake up.
Despite the lack of motivation, I made it to work on time every single time. A person's mood changes every single day. You might feel motivated today, and worn out the next day.

In the long run, building discipline and a strong work ethic is more important than motivation. Being disciplined means having a set a rules to follow no matter what. 
It is something that is core to a person's being.

If I set rules for myself, and tell myself I am going to complete at least two units of a course every single day. 
I am going to do it and not make excuses. If I felt lazy that day, I am going to tell myself that I screwed up. That is all there is to it. 
The point is to be aware of yourself. That is how we make improvements.
