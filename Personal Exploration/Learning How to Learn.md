Learning a new subject or topic can be very difficult, especially when we get older.
Is this really true? There is definitely correlation between age and the ability to learn.
In fact, a simple Google search would reveal many scientific studies that can show this correlation.
But correlation does not equate causation, I really want to challenge this topic from a logical standpoint.

### Why Learning as an Adult is Hard
When we are young, we were told to study hard and get good grades in school. 
For students, their full time job is to study, learn and play.
As we get older, we start to take on new responsibilities. 
We have to work to make money to sustain ourselves.
We have to deal with bills and taxes. 
We have to prepare our own meals.
As a result, the majority of us actually end up in something I'd like to call the "steady-state."
This is actually a chemical engineering term where the variables of a system are unchanging with time.
The same can be applied to life, we eventually reach a point where we settle with our life, and we try maintain the status quo.
We stop improving ourselves, because there is no motivation to do so.
We become very satisfied with what we have, and time goes by very quickly.

<em>One month - Two months - One Year - Two Years</em>

Time flashes by before our eyes. Then we realize that nothing has changed in the past three years.


### The Learning Mindset

Be honest with yourself, and ask yourself this question:

<b>Are you content with your life?</b>

If you answered yes, then I suggest you change the answer to no. You don't want to be content with your life.
You can be happy with your life, but never get too comfortable with it.
Once you are comfortable with your life, you stop evolving. 
Of course learning anything new will be difficult, because there are no goals.
If you truly want to change yourself, you have to be hungry.
You have to strive towards a goal, and work towards it every single day.
You want to be uncomfortable and challenged. Doing so allows us to push ourselves to the limits.
