I used to work as a traditional chemical process engineer. My job was to act as an overseer for a well established pharmaceutical production process.
It was a slow and steady job that provided me with a decent income. 
Eventually, I became very comfortable with my job and reached a point of stagnation.
I didn't want to feel complacent and settle into a job for money alone. So I asked myself a very important question.

<b>Is this the life I wanted?</b>

The Japanese concept of "Ikigai" strongly resonates with me. I was in the "Profession" portion of the Venn diagram.
My life lacked meaning, every morning I would wake up and head towards work like a robot.
I learned a lot from my first job, and I will forever be grateful for the opportunity. 
The process engineering and problem solving skills will probably stay with me for the rest of my life.
But I knew I needed change, so I left the company. 

At the time, I had no idea what I was doing in my life. After 10 months of wandering, I discovered Python and data science. I immediately fell in love.
I even created this website to document my journey. I might not have a job at the moment, but I feel ten times better than before.
I am finally doing something I can be truly passionate about.
