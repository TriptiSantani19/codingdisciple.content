Hi, my name is Seng Kin Chu, and I am the Coding Disciple. I am self-taught in Python, and I am a data science enthusiast.
I am passionate about learning and I strive to improve myself every single day. 

The purpose of this website is to provide educational content on data science to myself and to other learners.
For me, the best way to understand a concept is to explain it to someone else.
I explain various concepts in data science by coding using real world datasets and examples.

In addition to writing about technical concepts in data science, I also wanted a way to document my personal journey.
