My name is Seng Kin Chu, and I am the Coding Disciple. I am self-taught in Python, and I am a data science enthusiast.
I am passionate about learning and I strive to improve myself every single day. 

I used to work as a traditional chemical process engineer. My job was to act as an overseer for a well established pharmaceutical production process.
It was a slow and steady job that provided me with a decent income. I was a naive millennial with zero job experience, so I was terrible at working in a company environment. 
I had to learn all my soft skills, the hard way. Eventually, I became very comfortable with my job and reached a point of stagnation.
I didn't want to feel complacent, I wanted to be challenged. I also didn't want to settle into a job for money alone. So I asked myself a very important question.

<b>Is this the life I wanted?</b>

The Japanese concept of "Ikigai" strongly resonates with me. I was in the "Profession" portion of the Venn diagram.
My life lacked meaning, every morning I would wake up and head towards work like a robot.
I learned a lot from my first job, and I will forever be grateful for the opportunity. 
But I knew I needed change, so I left the company. 

At the time, I had no idea what I was doing in my life. After 10 months of wandering, I discovered Python and data science. I immediately fell in love.
I created this blog to document my journey towards Ikigai. But I also wish to inspire other people with the content on this blog.

I hope you enjoy your stay here!
